# PHP SDK

An SDK, or Software Development Kit, is a collection of software tools and libraries designed to help developers create applications and software. It's essentially a package that provides a set of tools, libraries, relevant documentation, code samples, processes, and guides that allow developers to create software applications on a specific platform.

SDKs are usually designed to be used for specific platforms or programming languages. For example, the Windows SDK is for developing applications for Windows, and the Java SDK is for developing Java applications.

In this artical, we will build a simple SDK for PHP and will post it on Composer.

## What is Composer?

Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

## What is Packagist?

Packagist is the main Composer repository. It aggregates public PHP packages installable with Composer.

## What is a Package?

A package is a library that is available for use in your project. The package can be a library that you have written yourself, or a third-party library that you have downloaded using Composer.


## What is a Package Manager?

A package manager is a tool that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing libraries/packages in a consistent manner. It typically maintains a database of software dependencies and version information to prevent software mismatches and missing prerequisites.

## What is a Dependency?

A dependency is a file or library that a program needs to run. For example, if you want to use a library that is written in PHP, you will need to install PHP on your computer. In this case, PHP is a dependency of the library.

## What is a Library?

A library is a collection of code that is designed to be used by other programs. It typically contains functions and classes that can be used to perform specific tasks, such as connecting to a database or sending an email.


## What is a Framework?

A framework is a collection of libraries that are designed to work together to provide a complete solution for a specific problem. For example, the Laravel framework is a collection of libraries that are designed to work together to provide a complete solution for building web applications.


## HOW TO CREATE A PHP SDK

### Step 1: Create a new project

Create a new project folder and create a composer.json file in it. The composer.json file is used to define the project dependencies. It is also used to define the project name, version, and description.

```json
{
    "name": "vendor/php-sdk",
    "description": "A simple PHP SDK",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Your Name",
            "email": "123@example.com",
            "homepage": "https://example.com"
        }
    ],
    "require": {}
}
```

### Step 2: Create a new class

Create a new class in the src folder. The class should be named after the package name. For example, if the package name is php-sdk, the class should be named PhpSdk.php.

```php
<?php

namespace PhpSdk;

class PhpSdk
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        echo 'Hello World!';
    }
}
```

You can also add a namespace to the class. For example, if the package name is php-sdk, the namespace should be PhpSdk.

And an example folder for testing the SDK.


This is the file structure of the project:

```text
php-sdk
├── composer.json
├── example
│   └── index.php
└── src
    └── PhpSdk.php
```

### Step 3: Add the class to the composer.json file

Add the class to the composer.json file. The class should be added to the autoload section. For example, if the package name is php-sdk, the class should be added to the autoload section.

```json
{
    "name": "vendor/php-sdk",
    "description": "A simple PHP SDK",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Your Name",
            "email": "123@example.com",
            "homepage": "https://example.com"
        }
    ],
    "require": {},
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "PhpSdk\\": "src/"
        }
    }
  }
```

### Step 4: Install the dependencies

Install the dependencies using Composer. The dependencies are defined in the composer.json file. For example, if the package name is php-sdk, the dependencies are defined in the composer.json file.

```bash
composer install
```

### Step 5: Test the SDK

Test the SDK by running the example file. For example, if the package name is php-sdk, the example file is located in the example folder.

```bash
php example/index.php
```

### Step 6: Publish the SDK

Publish the SDK to Packagist. Packagist is the main Composer repository. It aggregates public PHP packages installable with Composer.

### Step 7: Install the SDK

Install the SDK using Composer. Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

```bash
composer require php-sdk/php-sdk
```

### Step 8: Test the SDK

Test the SDK by running the example file. For example, if the package name is php-sdk, the example file is located in the example folder.

```bash
php example/index.php
```

### Step 9: Update the SDK

Update the SDK using Composer. Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

```bash
composer update php-sdk/php-sdk
```

### Step 10: Test the SDK

Test the SDK by running the example file. For example, if the package name is php-sdk, the example file is located in the example folder.

```bash
php example/index.php
```

### Step 11: Uninstall the SDK

Uninstall the SDK using Composer. Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

```bash
composer remove php-sdk/php-sdk
```
